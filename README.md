# Port Scanner For Linux Hosts PIVOTING

# This is a TCP port scanner script made in bash, thought-out for pivoting internal networks from a Linux Host that you have access, you just need to create the port scanner file in the Linux host that has internal networks that you want to scan and copy the script content in there and modify what you need.

# Usage: You have to change the IP address that is shown in the script for the IP address of the host in the internal network that you want to pivot.
